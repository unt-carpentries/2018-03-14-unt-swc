### Welcome to Software Carpentry

Before we begin, we ask that you complete the checklist to ensure that you have access to wi-fi, the etherpad, and that all software is installed.

* You should have received **two sticky notes**, one green (ready to go) and one red (having trouble), that you can use throughout the workshop to show the instructor and helper if things are going well or if you encounter any trouble.  If you have difficulty with any portion of the checklist, please place a red sticky note on the top of your laptop to indicate you need assistance. Once the issue is resolved, please take down the red sticky note and place the green sticky note at the top of your laptop.  Once you successfully complete the checklist, please place the green sticky note on your laptop to indicate that you are ready to begin.

* Log-in to **eaglenet** network with your EUID. If you do not have an EUID, please place a red sticky note on your laptop and ask the help for the wi-fi code.

* Open the webpage [etherpad short link] to access the **Etherpad**.  We will use this Etherpad to share links and snippets of code, take notes, ask and answer questions, and whatever else comes to mind. To start, please add yourself to the attendee list.
